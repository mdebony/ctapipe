The algorithms for muon ring fitting have been improved

- Upgrade the taubin_circle_fit with weights to avoid bias toward rings with larger radii
- Add the optional initial parameters : ring center and radius.
- Add a combined ring fitting method (kundu_chaudhuri_taubin).
- This new combined method is set to be the default method.
- Updated the test with an additional fitting method, each method is tested separately.
- Realistic muon ring simulation for all camera types implemented in the test with toy model.
- Include the parameter fit errors in the tolerance metric.
- Add error fields to the muon container.
- The API for MuonFitter has been modified.
- Minor documentation updates.
